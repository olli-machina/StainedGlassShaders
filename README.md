# StainedGlassShaders

### Sample Scene 1
This scene contains a basic demonstration of what our stained glass shaders do. There are 3 colored pieces of "glass" in the scene that can be changed using the color sliders and moved to display overlapping colors and moving light reflection.
The light source can also be manipulated to display the light projection and how the angles will reflect on the given surfaces.
This scene is intended to demonstrate a multi-pass shader that simulates the lighting with the phong shading interacting with the textue as well as completing the overall lighting effect from the glass sources.

### Sample Scene 2
The second demonstration shows a more extravagent display of the shaders. This scene has multiple light sources and randomly generated glass fragments to shine in a full area from the lights. A light that is inside of a glass fragment will also tint the entire scene accordingly wtith the proper color.
The lights are able to be dragged through the scene to demonstrate the overlap of colors, the directional movement in an exessive style compared to the first demonstration, the interaction of lights being overlapped entirely by glass, and the general radient effect of the shader.
It is also possible to delete a light source to see the more defined effects the light position has on each random shard of glass.
The black floor is intended to display vivid colors and obvious lighting to the user.

### Sample Scene 3
Animation of the stained glass is generated through this demo. The three glass shards animate by moving side-to-side at different speeds- using key-frame interpolation to smoothly glide across and generate the proper overlap events with our shader as the light connects and separates.
Each fragment will overlap one another at different points- showing the effects of the shader on an automated path rather than requiring user input to display the effects.
The color of the glass can be changed using Unity sliders to see the effects and manipulation of the lighting.
